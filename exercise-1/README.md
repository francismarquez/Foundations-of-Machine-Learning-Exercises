# Exercise 1
---

## Problem: 
1. Generate a 16x16-dim position encoding using an interweaved $sin$ and $cos$ functions: $B = \{ b_1,b_2,...,b_{16} \}$ where $b_i\,\epsilon\,\mathbb{R}^{16}$. Distribute the domain of 16-dim between $0$ to $2\pi$.

2. If $B$ is a set of basis vectors, are the vectors orthogonal? Orthonormal? If not, make the basis vectors orthogonal and orthonormal using  G-S method.

3. Generate a colored visualization of vectors in 1 and 2.
